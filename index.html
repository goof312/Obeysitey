          Obesity is a medical condition characterized by an excessive accumulation of body fat, which presents a risk
          to health. It is commonly assessed using the Body Mass Index (BMI), where a BMI of 30 or higher is classified
          as obese. Obesity increases the likelihood of various health problems, including cardiovascular diseases, type
          2 diabetes, certain types of cancer, and musculoskeletal disorders. It is influenced by a combination of
          genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors, including diet, physical activity levels, and socio-economic
          status. Managing obesity often involves lifestyle changes such as diet modification, increased physical
          activity, behavioral therapy, and, in some cases, medical or surgical interventions.

          Overweight and obesity result from an imbalance of energy intake (diet) and energy expenditure (physical
          activity). In most cases obesity is a multifactorial disease due to obesogenic environments, psycho-social
          factors and genetic variants. In a subgroup of patients, single major etiological factors can be identified
          (medications, diseases, immobilization, iatrogenic procedures, monogenic disease/genetic syndrome). The
          obesogenic environment exacerbating the likelihood of obesity in individuals, populations and in different
          settings is related to structural factors limiting the availability of healthy sustainable food at locally
          affordable prices, lack of safe and easy physical mobility into the daily life of all people, and absence of
          adequate legal and regulatory environment. At the same time, the lack of an effective health system response
          to identify excess weight gain and fat deposition in their early stages is aggravating the progression to
          obesity.
